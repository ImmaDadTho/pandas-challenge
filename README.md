## Module 4 

In this project I take data from a school district and aggregate the data to show any trends in school performance. I have been provided with the students math and reading scoreds as well as the schools budget and what schools they attend. The data I will be using is in a folder named `Resources` and will have two csv files labeled `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv` 

I will be creating different dataframes to help realize these trends:


## District Summary 

This will have the overall data that includes total number of schools, total number of students, the the total budget for all schools, the average of math and reading scores, and the percentage of students who passed math, reading and both.

## School Summary 

In this dataframe I will summarize the previous dataframe by schools. I will add the names of the schools and if it is a charter or distrcit type and this will also include the budget per student, each school will have the information corresponding to it from the previous dataframe.

## Highest Performing schools based on overall passing grade percantage

This will be were I get to see what the top five performing schools look like, how many students passed math, reading, or both and how much the school budget is and how much of it is allocated per student as well as the total amount of students per school.

## Lowest Performing schools based on overall passing grade percantage

This will be were I get to see what the lowest five performing schools look like, how many students passed math, reading, or both and how much the school budget is and how much of it is allocated per student as well as the total amount of students per school.

## Math scores by grade

Here I show what the average math scores were per grade at each school

## Reading scores by grade 

Here I show what the average reading scores were per grade at each school

## scores by school spending 

This is where I breakdown the school perfomances from the previous two dataframes to show what the average  spending was per student. This will compare the average scores, and the percentage of students who passed by the average spending ranges per students.

## scores by school size 

Here I will calculate the amount of students per school and will add this to the previous dataframe to get a better picture of the budget and size of the school compared to the students performances

## scores by school type 

This last Dataframe will have the school types `Charter` and `District` and will compare the perfomances of the students in each school type.
